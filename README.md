# Workspace_Setup_Launcher<br />
<br />
Automatically launch multiple applications on various workspaces via a single script and keybinding.<br />
<br />
Create keybinding to launch workspaces setup script.<br />
(Sup+1 = my_startup.sh)<br />
<br />
Another way I use this idea is to make individual scripts for specific workflows, regardless of the workspace you are working from.<br />
Ex. Web design script that launches vi in a terminal along with geany, filezilla, qutebrowser and gimp. Another one for video editing starts up vi, kdenlive, gimp, inkscape and qutebrowser. You get the idea.<br />
<br />
Create keybindings for each script and save yourself a lot of time instead of launching multiple applications seperately over and over.<br />
